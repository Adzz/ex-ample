# Example

Run the mix task. Add to examples_order. Re-arrange if desired.

TODO:

1. Mix task check file doesn't exist already
2. Add contents to home page.
3. Add next and previous to each example - take account of the ends... Sounds tricky
4. Add title on each page and footer.
5. Test?
6. Deploy
7. Custom domain name.
