<h3>With</h3>
<p>If you have nested case statements, or nested if statements you can usually flatten them with a with construct.</p>
<p>A with will pattern match the right hand side of the <- arrow to the left and if it matches will continue to the next statement</p>
<p>If it does not match it will fall through to the else.</p>
