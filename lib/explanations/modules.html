<h3>Modules</h3>
<p>In Elixir we group functions together with modules.
<p>Modules provide a namespace for functions, meaning you can have two functions with the same name and arity, but if they are in different modules they are different functions.</p>
<p>Modules also allow us to group together functions that belong with each other.</p>
